#this function makes sure the user does not input any unwanted values
#the function accepts 4 variables, a string and 3 floats
#the string is for the user to know what the value they are entering is for
#minimum and maximum are the lower and upper bounds for the value 
#defualt_val is the default value that the program returns if the user has 
#entered anything incorrect 


#this function works by comparing the value with the mac=ximum and the minimum
#and if this comes out to be true then the value is returned normally 
#if the value is incorrect then it is ignored and the default value is taken
#if a letter or symbol is entered then the value error is taken into account
#and the defualt value is still returned
